    <h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
    <p>Because the purpose of creating this software is to protect students as well as the staff and teachers, so its scope of activities is limited to campus. As the scopes are limited, so the capacity of holding data is not wide; we decide to develop and expand only simple functions unless the application turns out to be more popular than our expectations. First off all will be the automatic ID barcode scanning and input the entry data of time in and out of the school of each student online, we aim to make sure this function works smoothly and as fast as it could so that the data will appear on the host system nearly immediately. Next, we will design an automatic body thermometer for students, and integrated with it will be a system that automatically sprays hand sanitizer immediately after placing your hands in the temperature measurement compartment. Interestingly, if a student's body temperature is too high above the allowed average, the scanner will automatically deny the student to the school and immediately notify the host system.
However, the current plans have not yet been brought to reality due to many limitations, such as education level and testing period. As we are only first-year students, we have not learned any further or complex lessons nor experienced any other project before; so that our understanding is a very big limitation. This will take us very long to start making progress for this application; furthermore, after we can expand the functions, we still need to put the application through tests to make sure it works perfectly. Things will not stop at that point as we also need to gain trust from the school executives because this is an application developed for students, and it will only be used if there is approval from them to supply the information of the students.</p>

        <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
        <p>For this project, we determined that we will use Bluezone’s online source code to design our website. For the hardware part, we have been looking through and testing many temperature sensors and barcode scanners. But in result, we chose DHT11 temperature sensor model for scanning body temperature and PS/2 barcode scanner model to scan students’ IDs. The reason why we chose these models is because they are quite cheap, popular and newbie friendly so that our project can progress steadily.
</p>
        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>By the time we get the sensors and code, we have been reconstructing and testing it. First thing we did was to get our website’s code and Bluezone’s code together. That part was pretty hard since we did not have much knowledge about designing UI/UX and coding HTML. We had to look at Youtube videos, asking some friends and actually failed a lot to get it done. Then, the next part is choosing the right hardware parts. We learnt from many online tutorials about these Arduino sensors and went to HShop to buy some sensors and tested it at home. At first, the code used for programming this was C++ then we had to learn about C++ a little bit. Then, by watching Youtube videos, the code was done in approximately 2 weeks. There were a lot of bugs and we had to spend a lot of time to figure out those bugs and fix them. Then, the hardest part was getting the barcode scanner to work correctly with the data on the website. We spent so much time on this part because we did not completely understand the code on the website and we had to code the website and the scanner over and over again. There were also many minor problems	such as the sensor was dead, someone’s computer could not run the website.
</p>
        <h3>Timeframe</h3>

        <h3>Risks</h3>
        <p>Although our website and application are always available for everyone, there would still be people who won’t have our application downloaded or filling in the required information on our website. If there were to be a student who has interacted with a person or people who don’t use our applications or fill in the needed data on our website it would be impossible for us to know whether that student is completely safe from the virus. This means that even with the assistance from the application, website, and the automated entrances that could scan for symptoms as well as the body temperature the information can never be 100% correct. But the chance of the student who could be infected by the virus will still be very low because there is still the step where the school will be doing cross collation with the data about the student, and then will decide to permit the student to come to the campus or not.
The website and application will stumble upon bugs every once in a while, and we still need to spend time rewriting the codes or debugging. The automated entrances and the sensors on the entrance will need to be maintenance after a certain amount of time. Both of these will cost both time, manpower and money.

        <h3>Group processes and communications</h3>
    <p>Communication is an essential part in pretty much any activity in life, academic life is included as well. It is a foundation to develop advanced skills, so communication breakdown absolutely affects the quality of group projects. During the previous group assignment, it was hard for the group members to communicate with each other because some members barely make it to the group discussions so sometimes there were members that were behind what the team had discussed. The lack of communication was rather alarming because it caused the workflow to be slowed down at a noticeable rate, not to mention some of the group members procrastinated too. But this time, although our team only has 3 members left, we all participated in group meetings and gave out plans as well as the parts each person in the group will be working on. Also, the group chat is more lively now as everyone talks more often and keeps their work progress updated on the group so it is super easy to keep track with what everyone is doing with their tasks.

        <h3>Skills and Jobs</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>UI designer - This job will pay attention to visual experience through users’ screens or simply UI (User Interface) Designer will take responsibility for a tool that users use to communicate with a product such as a video game or a website and an app. To be specific, this project requires a UI designer for a website. Soft skills such as communication, collaboration as well as empathy are core skills every designer should experience. Staying as professional design positions, entry-level designers have to learn about design and prototyping tools, fundamental theories and hands-on experiences for hard skills.
</li>
                <li>Website developer - I can assume that this job includes many elements of User Interface designer and software developer. Web development is the end stage before accepting users’ access. Moreover, its works sometimes needed discussing with the clients to catch up with their satisfaction and expectations. Communication, cooperation and connection are necessary skills because the website will be improved efficiently via the clients’ feedback. Lots of specialised skills are required website application, website programming languages and software programs
</li>
                <li>Software developer - The major duty of this position is to be in charge of outline and write code depending on user requirements, developing software explication and controlling performance. Other tasks combine mapping software to be recorded for improvement and innovation. Especially in soft skills, software developers will work with other specialists to ensure that there are no errors before launching.
</li>
                <li>Risk manager - This is the last position my team needs to add into our project idea because this project will be persuasive and acceptable if our group has the ability to perform effectively and exposes out-standing benefits that our project idea can bring into a community. Therefore, risk managers can analyze potential threats and have preventive measures to diminish problems as much as possible.
