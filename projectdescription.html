<h2>Project Description</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<h4>Topic</h4>
<p> This project aims towards the safety of every student, as well as any other workers during this pandemic to avoid any possible covid-19 transmission in work, study environments. Instead of giving out more tasks for security guards because they have to check your student, worker’s ID and also measure your temperature manually and the students, workers have to spend extra time every day to go through these examination steps. The completed product from this project will remove all the hassles for the security guards, and will also perform these checking tasks more efficient because it will be an automated system that will analyze and determine whether to let the person into the work, study environment or not based on how much data of the students, workers it has collected.
The project would also help the government to have better control over the transmissions within the country. If there were to be an epidemic, the ability to localize will be faster. Because the system is able to track down most of the locations of the people who have filled out the required information for it to have the needed data and start to find the previous locations of where that person has gone to. This will save us a lot of time during an epidemic because with the help of this system we would be able to locate and zone out where the people with the potential of carrying the pathogen within them. Therefore, the possibility of infected people bringing the virus to other areas within the country is very low.
</p>
<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p> The Covid-19 pandemic has changed the world drastically. It also brought changes to our daily life, the public, economic, and the environment. Although Vietnam is doing a splendid job at handling the epidemic, people are still worried about the risk of infection because to be able to find out a person has the virus within themselves takes quite a lot of time. Quarantine areas help a lot during this pandemic, but there are always people with low self-discipline who will always travel around knowing that they should have isolated themselves for the required amount of time before going out again. This project is crucial for us in these trying times because it is meant for providing further assistance for our country that is dealing with the pandemic, giving out solutions to seemingly unresolved problems. This would show to a future employer that each of our group members is able to think critically about vital public problems, come up with solutions, and implement them.</p>
<h4>Landscape</h4>
<p> Surprisingly Bluezone is the only application that shares similar ideas to the project that my team is working on. Apparently there are zero competitors out there because this project is for improving our quality of life during the pandemic. Applying the same concept as Bluezone’s but this time with improvements that solve the unsolved problems we are having with controlling the epidemic at the moment. Bluezone accesses some of our personal data on our phones and we have to be using the app, as well as being connected to the network for it to be able to know other people who are also connected to the network through the app and allow the users to find out if the people around are safe to interact or be around with them. Whereas our project, the new system will use the personal data to analyze and then detect if the person has interacted with anyone who could be a potential virus carrier before. Not to mention the advanced entrances will also have temperature, ID scanners, combined with remote hand sanitizers which will do all the extra work for the security guards, remove all the usual placed hand sanitizers around the work, study areas because people hardly ever use them due to the fact that everyone acknowledges that avoiding physical touch is a very crucial thing during this pandemic.</p>
<h3>Aims</h3>
<p> We want to develop an application that can be more helpful to school administrators this season. The main purpose is to create a piece of software that can better localize and monitor people with or at risk of COVID-19, at least in the school area, and to avoid further spread to healthy people. Moreover, we also want to be able to provide students with a healthier and safer environment so that they can rest assured and continue pursuing their academic path.

Our immediate goal is for everyone to be able to reduce their concerns at this critical moment. Moreover, we also want to be able to provide students with a healthier and safer environment so that they can rest assured and continue pursuing their academic path, not during this pandemic only, but it can also be used in the future under similar circumstances.

<h3>Plans and Progress</h3>
<p> About a story why we came up with the system for RMIT students in an epidemic.  Individually we were so creative with our personal ideal project in Assignment 1. Thinh’s ideal project is a smart home which equipped with lots of advanced technology can work without physical interaction. Moreover, it can contact a hospital or some organizations if any members in your family have unexpected problems. The second idea is a strategy game that will have a gacha system. Game world drastically eases and gamer officially becomes a job that many people can earn a living from. The third is sensor hand sanitizer systems at RMIT campus to protect students from potential infection in COVID-19. And Chatbot for Disabled people is the last opinion, it has promising benefits for society, but through four ideal projects, we analyze which project will work effectively in that moment. Therefore, a system including a hand sanitizer and temperature as well as ID scanners is the most optimal solution for our whole project idea. The reason why it conducts in our campus, not for humanity is individuals should stay alert and raise awareness of the implicit damages, if the minority is controlled totally we are able to  spread a project in majority. </p>
    <p>To be able to do this well, we must first ensure immediate success in managing student status. Students on campus are required to fill out a form on the system and fill in information about themselves, their recent movements, and their health status. All student names will be entered first on the system. However, students who do not complete an application will not be able to enter the school. The students who have completed the information will be considered automatically by the algorithm pre-installed on the software.</p>

<p>More specifically, this software will work with a sensor scanner to do detecting work on behalf of the school employees to limit the direct interaction between one individual and others. This device will be placed at the school gate to scan the student ID cards before allowing students to enter the school, track the information of the card owners and show whether they are allowed to enter the school or not. The machine will then measure the body temperature directly by asking the student to put their hands into the machine's sensor, automatically saving the person's health information to the system.</p>
<p>About our working timeline for this project, each member has made such progress during the whole semester. In week 9, we divided our new roles and started to do further research. To be more specific, on Monday of week 9, Trang did research on Bluezone Adaption, then on Wednesday, Thinh did some research on Government Responsibility. Later on Friday, we met up and together we did research on personal regulations. </p>
<p>On week 10, our main goal is to create a github repository and write 3 essay parts. Starting from Tuesday, Khanh managed our team profile's part. Later on Thursday, Thinh did his part about the Tools, and on Saturday of week 10, Trang wrote a description for our project. 
<p><li>Moving on to week 11, in this week, we aimed to meet up, discuss, and finish other sections. Thinh started early this week, on Monday, he came up with our group's plan and progress. Then on Wednesday, Trang updated with our timeframe, and Khanh checked and made some additional changes to our information. </li>
<li>Week 12 was getting more intense as we were a week nearer to the deadline's due date, so we aimed to finish our whole project this week, make it available on Github and give some adjustment before submitting. Khanh came up first with his personal feedback and he did the aims part again on Monday, and on Friday, he started posting on Github. Following next is Trang's redoing the group process on Tuesday, and checking again on Thursday to make sure everything was well and carefully done. Last but not least, Thinh was redoing his plan and progress part on Wednesday. Later on Friday, we decided to put our assigned parts on Github together.</li>
<li>On week 13, we needed to submit our video and give a presentation of our idea. There were no personal tasks this week for any individual of the group. We prepared the content on Monday, met for video recording on Tuesday, submitted our last products on Wednesday, met for practicing on Thursday, and finally, we gave our official performance on Friday. </li>
<li>After performing in class, on week 14, we receive the feedbacks, and decide to redo the parts that are not good enough. Thinh will work on realistic ideas on Monday, then Trang will work on an achievable plan on Wednesday. 
<li>Moving to week 15, we will work on creating visual concepts. Khanh will design a website that has the same working system as Bluezone's on Tuesday. Trang will draw the first draft of the model of the hand sanitizers on Thursday, and Thinh will be developing an entrance system with temperature and ID scanners. </li>
<li>On week 16, we will start a survey on RMIT students to see how they react to our project. Khanh will send out the surveys on Monday to small groups of students. Then we will adjust the project based on the results of the survey and after that, we will send an email to RMIT organization for conduction.</li>
<li>With RMIT permission, on week 17 Thinh and Khanh will find out and test body temperature sensor and barcode scanner which are integral parts to set up the system. But we should balance cost and productivity. It is worthy to build an expensive system, isn’t it? Individually I think it will be a controversial project within cost investment. </li>
<li>After buying all necessary stuff, we will list any obstacles we will face to apply into reality such as productive machines, financial issues and student perception on week 18.</li>
<li>Checking all parts carefully before writing code and designing websites within three ideal positions as Software developer, User Interface Designer as well as website Developer. Individuals will take responsibility for personal sections.</li>
<li>On week 20, we will have an online test for small groups in RMIT. To check attendance, we can realize the advantages and disadvantages of this project through the first try.</li>
    <li>Definitely the first try usually has unexpected shortcoming, but that is the only solution we can realize to fix it. There are some recommendations we can make use of, contacting specific students to ask them which parts they see have negative points. In addition, lots of specialists are interested in entrepreneurs’ projects, they are willing to engage in discussion. As a result, to choose the optimals strategies for the final launch on week 21.</li>
        <li>Then the first system will be applied at the entrance because we will manage it actively, have external observation if the systems can be in charge of human source or not.</li>
          <li>With student reflection, we can determine to reinstall all the traditional systems into the modern ones which we are going to work through 16 weeks together</li>
        <li>Finally on week 24, it is a pride for not only our group but also RMIT University to be recognized within a useful project to raise awareness of every student, also the government can control citizens appropriately which makes parents rest assured to allow their children to keep going to school as usual.</li></p>
