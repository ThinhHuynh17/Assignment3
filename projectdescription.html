<h2>Project Description</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<h4>Topic</h4>
<p> This project aims towards the safety of every student, as well as any other workers during this pandemic to avoid any possible covid-19 transmission in work, study environments. Instead of giving out more tasks for security guards because they have to check your student, worker’s ID and also measure your temperature manually and the students, workers have to spend extra time every day to go through these examination steps. The completed product from this project will remove all the hassles for the security guards, and will also perform these checking tasks more efficient because it will be an automated system that will analyze and determine whether to let the person into the work, study environment or not based on how much data of the students, workers it has collected.
The project would also help the government to have better control over the transmissions within the country. If there were to be an epidemic, the ability to localize will be faster. Because the system is able to track down most of the locations of the people who have filled out the required information for it to have the needed data and start to find the previous locations of where that person has gone to. This will save us a lot of time during an epidemic because with the help of this system we would be able to locate and zone out where the people with the potential of carrying the pathogen within them. Therefore, the possibility of infected people bringing the virus to other areas within the country is very low.
</p>
<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p> The Covid-19 pandemic has changed the world drastically. It also brought changes to our daily life, the public, economic, and the environment. Although Vietnam is doing a splendid job at handling the epidemic, people are still worried about the risk of infection because to be able to find out a person has the virus within themselves takes quite a lot of time. Quarantine areas help a lot during this pandemic, but there are always people with low self-discipline who will always travel around knowing that they should have isolated themselves for the required amount of time before going out again. This project is crucial for us in these trying times because it is meant for providing further assistance for our country that is dealing with the pandemic, giving out solutions to seemingly unresolved problems. This would show to a future employer that each of our group members is able to think critically about vital public problems, come up with solutions, and implement them.</p>
<h4>Landscape</h4>
<p> Surprisingly Bluezone is the only application that shares similar ideas to the project that my team is working on. Apparently there are zero competitors out there because this project is for improving our quality of life during the pandemic. Applying the same concept as Bluezone’s but this time with improvements that solve the unsolved problems we are having with controlling the epidemic at the moment. Bluezone accesses some of our personal data on our phones and we have to be using the app, as well as being connected to the network for it to be able to know other people who are also connected to the network through the app and allow the users to find out if the people around are safe to interact or be around with them. Whereas our project, the new system will use the personal data to analyze and then detect if the person has interacted with anyone who could be a potential virus carrier before. Not to mention the advanced entrances will also have temperature, ID scanners, combined with remote hand sanitizers which will do all the extra work for the security guards, remove all the usual placed hand sanitizers around the work, study areas because people hardly ever use them due to the fact that everyone acknowledges that avoiding physical touch is a very crucial thing during this pandemic.</p>
<h3>Aims</h3>
<p> We want to develop an application that can be more helpful to school administrators this season. The main purpose is to create a piece of software that can better localize and monitor people with or at risk of COVID-19, at least in the school area, and to avoid further spread to healthy people. Moreover, we also want to be able to provide students with a healthier and safer environment so that they can rest assured and continue pursuing their academic path.

Our immediate goal is for everyone to be able to reduce their concerns at this critical moment. Moreover, we also want to be able to provide students with a healthier and safer environment so that they can rest assured and continue pursuing their academic path, not during this pandemic only, but it can also be used in the future under similar circumstances.
</p>
<h3>Plans and Progress</h3>
<p> To be able to do this well, we must first ensure immediate success in managing student status. Students on campus are required to fill out a form on the system and fill in information about themselves, their recent movements, and their health status. All student names will be entered first on the system. However, students who do not complete an application will not be able to enter the school. The students who have completed the information will be considered automatically by the algorithm pre-installed on the software.

More specifically, this software will work with a sensor scanner to do detecting work on behalf of the school employees to limit the direct interaction between one individual and others. This device will be placed at the school gate to scan the student ID cards before allowing students to enter the school, track the information of the card owners and show whether they are allowed to enter the school or not. The machine will then measure the body temperature directly by asking the student to put their hands into the machine's sensor, automatically saving the person's health information to the system. Finally, it will spray the students' hands with hand sanitizer to ensure their hygiene.
