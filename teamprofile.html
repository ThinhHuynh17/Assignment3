<h2>Team Profile</h2>
<ul>
    <li><h3>1. Team Name: Alert Campaigners</h3></li>
           <p>Because of unexpected change, our groups shift into 3 members. Hence, the KOVI Campaigners is not our team name anymore because we do not have a Korean partner. We change into Alert Campaigners, the excuse is most people do not pay attention to the damaged effect that COVID-19 potentially causes on account of the decrease of the cases in RMIT individuals and Vietnam in general. We came up with the Project idea which guides people stay alert and raise awareness of the COVID-19 implicit community infection, from which to have a prevention for a society.</p>
    <li><h3>2. Personal Information:</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li>- Trang:</li>
            <img src="Aimaxinhthe.jpg" alt="trang" width="70%">
            <p>My name is Pham Hoai Mai Trang, s3836323 is my student number and absolutely it is used for my email account s3836323@rmit.edu.vn.  My nationality is Vietnamese but I am not Saigonese.  I am from Vung Tau city, which is more tranquil than Ho Chi Minh city because of the beach. It is over one kilometer from Saigon to my hometown and takes an hour and a half to move. An introverted character describes me a lot not only in every relationship. But if this environment requires me to affiliate with teammates, I can balance my energy, my mood following specific situations, and after that I will return my original version of myself. About my hobbies, I spend most of my time practicing guitar and connecting with my intuition. The most valuable lesson I remind myself is your value is defined via your enlightenment and your personality in any circumstance. Honestly, I do not have the entire background about IT (Information Technology), but I am interested in Turtlebot which is a low-cost individual robot developed by Melonee Wise and Tully Foote in 2010. I took inspiration from high school when I took part in an automatic technology competition. </p>
            <li>- Khanh:</li>
            <img src="Khanh.jpg" width="30%" alt="profilepic">
            <p> My name is Ngo Nhat Khanh, and my student number is s3818414. Through-out 12 years of education in bilingual schools, I am able to use both Vietnamese and English competently. I’ve moved to different schools a few times: starting from AIS, then VAS, I spent a year in BCIS after finishing primary school in VAS but I ended up returning to VAS after just one year in BCIS and finished high school there, in VAS. I usually play games in my free time, I mostly play Dota 2 with my best friends, but there are times we’d just play other fun online co-op games. I also participate in the badminton club in RMIT when the club is available on certain days of the week. I have always been a video game enthusiast, which means I am very into learning about game development, as well as graphics design in video games. The process of creating a high-quality game has always been thrilling to me. I have little experience with web programming and creating games as I have learned these during secondary school but never got to learn about them again in the later years and up until now, so my skills are very rusty at the moment. </p>
            <li>- Thinh:</li>
                <img scr="Thinh.png" width="20%" alt="thinh">
                <p>My name is Huynh Hung Thinh, my student ID is s3750559. My nationality is Vietnamese. In my free time, I love playing games,
                    listening to music, playing chess or watching movies. About career interests, I love learning about AI, autonomous technology and machine learning.
                    I also have some experience in arduino and working with python. Back when I was at high school, I was lucky enough to have a ticket to a tech
                    talk and the topic was "How to learn AI as a beginner", the event was organized by TopDev and it was fascinating and so curious to know what
                    AI can do in our life. And that event sparked my inspiration to become a software developer. I realized that there are so many things I can do with
                    a computer and a lab, I can create many apps which improve our daily lives. And it would be greater if I can apply AI and machine learning, which I
                    know it really requires a very advanced amount of knowledge to fully understand about it. But overall, becoming a software developer has always been
                    my dream, and I will surely work hard for what I have been dreaming abou</p>
     <li><h3>Group Process</h3></li>
            <p>About meetings in Assignment 2, we had face to face meetings after the tutorial class every Wednesday. We formed our group in Week 5 and had 4 meetings from week 5 to week 9 after the class except week 7. We proceeded with the meeting for at least 20 minutes and in each meeting, we discussed and framed the plan. The regular meeting was also the chance to check if the plan progressed satisfactorily and if there is any problem or concerns.
            </p>
            <li><b>1st meeting</b> (Week 5, 30 minutes) - Established the overall plan and proposed the framework. The IT Work part which required the contact with an IT professional and help of him/her was discussed as a high priority.
</li>
            <li><b>2nd meeting</b> (Week 6, 20 minutes) - Create the github repository (But a new repository was made at week 7 due to the continuous error we could not resolve.), Divided 4 of the area in the IT Technologies section who is going to take charge of which area.
            </li>
            <li><b>3rd meeting</b> (Week 8, 25 minutes) - Developed the Project Idea which was determined in the virtual meeting. Organization and arrangement about the Interview that was conducted in the previous week.
            </li>
            <li><b>4th meeting</b> (Week 9, 20 minutes) - Checked every part which should have been written. Discussed about Feedback and Group Reflection part.</li>
            <p>We had to divide specific parts for project planning in Assignment 3 owing to one member’s leave. We still work efficiently and effectively because this is the last assignment that has the highest percentage of total marks. Time is limited than the previous at the beginning, but we had an extension from week 9 to which 13, because week 9 we had already finished Assignment 2 on Wednesday, and kept researching more for Assignment 3. Hence, we proceeded with the meeting for at least 30 minutes, we are confidently up to our own particular strengths and we are willing to do a favor if any members need help.
            </p>
            <li><b>5th meeting</b> (Week 9, 10 minutes) - Dividing new roles in Assignment 3 and starting research for unsure information.
            </li>
            <li><b>6th online discussion</b>discussion (Week 10, 20 minutes) - Create the github repository, as Assignment 2, we separated to small notepads and submitted all files for a whole Assignment. We hope the previous problem does not happen anymore, it took a lot of time and energy to solve it.
            </li>
            <li><b>7th meeting</b> (Week 10, 30 minutes) - We made clear the project ideas within achievable results. Concentrating on not only a big picture but also intricate details for further extra weeks process planning.</li>
            <li><b>8th online meeting</b> (Week 11, 20minutes) - We were working hard on Plan and Progress and Timeframe parts, it is developed by collecting all members' ideas as much as possible.
            </li>
            <li><b>9th online meeting</b> (Week 12, 20 minutes) - Some parts we had the identical content, so we had to redo it and make clarity through other feedbacks</li>
            <li><b>10th online meeting</b> (Week 12, 35 minutes) - Checked all parts carefully before pushing to Github. Working on Feedback individually and Group Reflection together. (Week 12 we just had online meeting because of other course Assignments or tests, we sympathized with each other and encouraged to keep working on individual sections)
            </li>
            <li><b>12th meeting</b> (Week 13, 20 minutes) - We need to prepare content for Video Submission, firstly, we incline to make a powerpoint presentation which makes every member know exactly what we will present confidently and fluently with the flows and time limit.
            </li>
            <li><b>13th meeting</b> (Week 13, 25 minutes) - The last preparation for our total course, we are happy to be a groupmate, so it is our achievement we are going to have during the 8 weeks project. It is not a long time, yet we have wonderful friendships here not only in Information Technology class but also in a student life.
            </li>
            <p>About <b>the HTML and CSS</b>, every member contributes to HTML and one member took charge of CSS. Each member pushes and commits their own part to the one common repository. To collaborate and to push and commit freely in GitHub repository, we used the method that invited the collaborator. Because we estimated that no need to grant any permission of one member is much more accessible. By inviting each team member to allow the access to the one certain repository, we could push and pull the outcome at each member’s local repository. Everyone could check the contributions of each member in the github repository recorded at Insights section.
            </p>
            <p>This is our <b>experimental emotions</b> we incorporate with each other in Assignment 2, some doubt at the first meeting were confronted with our appropriate solution and productivity and satisfaction are valuable experiences we got in the end. In the middle of week 9, one member announced that she would change into another team which is a surprise scenario, but she had private excuses and the other members accepted and embraced the new situation.  Now we have 3 members which does not mean we will be less productable, we still work enthusiastically as an initial group. The main reason is we know individual personality through 4 Weeks in Assignment 2 so far, we can divide specific parts appropriately. Moreover, when every communication gets easier the flow of work will be smooth and also conflict is not an obsession for discussion. But losing one source which means every member has to take more responsibility to take over extra parts. To deal with it efficiently, we come up with a progressing schedule - what stage of plan an individual is up to, and personal difficulties are precisely solved to catch up with the planning flows.
            </p>
       <li><h3>Career Plans</h3></li>
            <li><b>Trang:</b> Designer</li>
            <p>Saishunkan company has posted online recruitment about Designer Position. It requires JavaScript, Graphic Design, HTML5, UI Frameworks, UX skills. Besides that, this position requests soft skills to carry out customers’ analysis to have specific distribution that has efficient methods for the company. The perks of the job have benevolent allowances, especially Japanese language; overtime pay and holidays, events per month. This position appeals to me because it relates to art and I am willing to work with various characteristics.  About my career plan, I pay attent to design skills like Graphic Design, Flat Drawing, UE (User Experience) and UI ( User Interface) as Graphic Design.</p>
            <li><b>Khanh:</b> Game Designer</li>
            <p> Cygames is looking for additional game development engineers to expand their business. The specific work content for this position: Design/development/test/operation of high-end games and libraries ; Plan feasibility, able to develop proposals and improvement plans ; Research and development of new functions. The position seems usual compared to other companies in the gaming industry but it’s actually very appealing to me because I’d get to work as a game development engineer in the company that made the gacha game (Granblue Fantasy) that I enjoy playing so much and I would love to contribute to Cygames in improving their games and work on future projects.</p>
            <li><b>Thinh:</b> Software Development Engineer</li>
            <p>This position requires designing and writing code to manipulate many applications, also working with a variety of software components as well as hardware. Moreover, being an engineer means you also need a good understanding and knowledge of operating systems, multicore embedded software and other subjects such as mathematics. Additionally, this is my ideal job and Intel is the company that I am looking forward to working there. I would like to contribute my knowledge and technical skills to work there.</p>

            <li><h3>Compare and Contrast</h3></li>
            <p>Through the team members' ideal jobs, most requirements in baseline skills are communication, collaboration as well as programming languages. Khanh and Trangs ideal job(Game developer and Designer) focus more on Analytical Skills and Creativity because their output will present to the customers directly. The only difference between Khanh and Trang’s ideal job is that Game developer requires a lot of coding, and the understanding of programming language. They need to know about clients’ experiences to improve our current situations. Trang and Khanh tend to work in Japanese operations, so getting Japanese certification is a baseline skill they should start learning in student life. Thinh position is likely to require lots of master certifications and accomplished experiences as Specialist or Engineer. His specialised skills stay focused on operating systems and application development. Based on the top IT Job Titles at the Burning Glass Data in 2018,  Graphic Design is the highest rate in all of them - top two in a chart, the second is Software Development Engineer and last but not least is Game Development Engineer. Anyway, each position will have enticing aspects that the others feel difficult to engage in if it is not their own interest or maybe one day, we will collaborate with each other and start up an IT (Information Technology) company in the future.
